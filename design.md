## Typography - Specific to SR

Fonts, I don't like generate appear of Gentium book. 

What about Cormorant Garamond with the current headers? It's really light but might work with the headers? (Actually, its pretty nice. I like it.) 
Worth a try, but I think Libre Baskerville might be better overall for book text. I wish it had a bold italics style though. 

Man, I really need a typeface with a small caps style too. I might have to fake the small caps, which is not ideal, but...

Algerian might be an interesting font for headers. 

Ibm plex serif is quite good for body text. 

Ounce is our header font with swashes turned on. and maybe italics


### Paragraphs

in general the paragraphs in sr are short. And very often just one sentence, rather then running text, which means that indented paragraphs look a little odd. there is a bit of running text, but not all that much.,
