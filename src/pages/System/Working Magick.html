<h1 id="working-magick">Working Magick</h1>
<p>Magick is a broad term for creating changes in reality through an effort of your Enlightened Will. Such an effort is called a <em>working.</em></p>
<p>It is possible to accomplish any change with Magick but the larger and more complex a working you attempt the more dice Reality will have to resist your action.</p>
<h2 id="the-basis-of-magick">The Basis of Magick</h2>
<p>Your avatar is the basis of your Magick. Without it you cannot store or channel quintessense and you cannot work magick.</p>
<h2 id="the-power-of-your-practice">The Power of your Practice</h2>
<p>If you can describe how you accomplish your working within the context of your magickal <em>practice</em> you may add dice from your mundane traits in addition to your magickal ones.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your practice is witchcraft you might collect some physical token from your victim and create a poppet you can poke. Going through the effort of accomplishing your working in terms of your practice allows you to add your Mental and Occult traits.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="raw-magick">Raw Magick</h2>
<p>It is possible to work Magick as an act of pure will. <em>Raw Magick</em> allows you to affect changes without the strictures of your <em>practice</em>. It is quicker and simpler, but more dangerous and difficult because only the Mystick traits (Arete and Spheres) can be used.</p>
<h2 id="workings-and-rolls">Workings and rolls</h2>
<p>One mage, or several together, may accomplish a working in a single roll, or over the course of several rolls. Each roll, if successful, accumulates <em>effect dice</em> until the working is accomplished or paradox triumphs.</p>
<h3 id="effect-dice">Effect Dice</h3>
<p>Each working has one, or more, distict effects represented by an <em>effect die</em>. You choose how many and how large, the effect dice of your working will be.</p>
<p>Pick your Effect Dice, the larger and grander they are, the more powerful your working will be.</p>

<p>Table: Effect Die rating</p>
<h2 id="spheres">Spheres</h2>
<p>Once your working is clearly defined we’ll determine how complex it is by determining its Sphere components. That is, what ratings of which Spheres your working will require.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example: You need to cross a gap between two building to escape some technocratic agents. You might calculate the coordinates of the rooftop you wish to be on and run a quick script on your wrist computer to alter your token’s position in the virtual reality simulation that is reality; effectively teleporting across the distance. This would accomplish your working using the sphere of Correspondence at d8.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Alternately: You might speak a spell that calls upon mystick winds to levitate you across the gap. Making use of the Sphere of Forces at d8.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is possible for your working to have multiple effects of the same Sphere. This is especially common with Correspondence and Prime because those Spheres are used for common meta-magickal effects. Such as targeting and extending the duration of your working.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, if you combine a d8 fire attack with a d8 levitation asset into a single working, you are controlling two distinct Forces which requires two d8 Forces components.</p>

<p>Table: Generic Sphere Ratings</p>
<h3 id="meta-magick">Meta-magick</h3>
<p>Some spheres extend the possibilities of your work instead of directly relating to your effect and we refer to these as meta-magick. The two most common are Correspondence to target your working and Prime to extend the duration of it.</p>
<p>Meta-magick components are not required, but they are always separate sphere components.</p>
<h4 id="targeting">Targeting</h4>
<p>By default a working is localized to you and your immediate environment, but by adding a Correspondence component  it can reach a distant target or location. With the addition of Spirit your working can reach into other worlds as well.</p>
<p>Targeting with Correspondence can be a matter of distance or, reaching a target through something closely related to them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The use of a “lock of hair” is a classic example of relational Correspondence from the practice of Witchcraft.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="targeting-by-range">Targeting by Range</h5>
<p>Range targeting allows for vast distances but even if you have the ability to target anywhere on earth you must be able to identify a particular target. This can be done with line of sight unaided by mundane effects such as cameras or telescopes (mystick effects that match your focus may help), or by knowing in great detail where your target is at this exact moment. Without one of those things, you will need to use relational targeting instead.</p>
<h5 id="targeting-by-relation">Targeting by Relation</h5>
<p>With relational targeting you must possess a thing that has some strong connection to your target which you’ll use to channel your magick at them.</p>

<h5 id="targeting-through-worlds">Targeting through Worlds</h5>
<p>It is also possible to use the sphere of spirit to reach into other worlds and dimentions with your working. This usually must be done in conjunction with realtional targeting lest your working reach the intended world but not your target. However, for planes close to the physical, such as the astral, you may be able to combine extra-dimensionality with range targeting because the two share a spacial relation.</p>

<h3 id="flaws-and-consequences">Flaws and Consequences</h3>
<p>The most common way for reality to bleed off the tension of being forcibly changed is when 1s are rolled on a magickal action. These opportunities can be activated to represent either the unintended consequences of a spell, or reality weaving flaws into a working.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, a fire spell may reasonably set unintended things on fire D8, because of some opportunities. A reflex enhancing life spell may require the target to ‘eat frequently d6’ to prevent the spell from fading.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When an opportunity is rolled on a magickal action, the mage gets a PP and some kind of d6 complication. The complication can be stepped up by using extra opportunities, or additional complications can be created.</p>
<p>These complications can be quite varied, but reality’s favorite tactic is to punish mages with its own scientific paradigm.</p>
<p>?<br />
can opportunities rolled by mages also just add directly to their paradox if there’s no particularly interesting consequences to be had? Maybe, but that would return some of that decision making to the gm. Of course, if the gm can’t think of anything…mmm…<br />
?</p>
<h3 id="reality-resists-your-magick">Reality Resists Your Magick</h3>
<p>Once you’ve rolled for your feat, Reality will oppose you with a dice pool based on your effect dice and the Sphere components of your feat.</p>
<ul>
<li>Locality

<li>Includes a place’s locality trait</li>

<li>This may even be paradox generated by opportunities you created when rolling for your feat</li>
<li>Optionally, reality may pay you a PP per die to keep the paradox it used, otherwise they are permanently spent</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your feat is Coincidental Reality gets 2 dice for it’s total.</p>
<p>If your feat is Vulgar Reality gets 3 dice for it’s total [and you will get an extra d6 Paradox regardless of whether your feat succeeds or fails.]</p>
<h3 id="outcomes">Outcomes</h3>
<p>If reality fails to beat your total by at least 1 your feat is a success. Otherwise, your effect dice gets added to your paradox pool, and perhaps greater retribution if paradox burns off.</p>
<h2 id="paradox">Paradox</h2>
<p>Paradox is an expression of reality’s resistance to being manipulated by the awakened. It accumulates as a Complication which hinders workings; it weaves its way into spells as flaws and unintended consequences; and sometimes paradox explodes in a reality bending backlash against a mage that can scar, twist, or trap them in a bubble of strange reality known as Quiet.</p>
<p>Paradox can be generated only when an enlightened will is invoked to affect changes in reality. It’s created in the smallest way from spoilers rolled on magickal actions, and in a more serious way from attempting vulgar magick, but the most dangerous cause of paradox is failing a magickal action.</p>
<h3 id="the-paradox-complication">The Paradox Complication</h3>
<p>Each mage has a single complication which represents their personal accumulation of paradox, growing and waiting to discharge.</p>
<h4 id="detecting-paradox">Detecting Paradox</h4>
<p>The size of a mage’s Paradox complication can be detected with a Prime 1 effect.</p>
<h4 id="paradox-hinders-magick">Paradox Hinders Magick</h4>
<p>When resisting a mage’s workings reality adds that mage’s Paradox complication to it’s dice pool.</p>
<p>If mage’s are performing a group working, each mage is responsible for a part of the overall effect and each mage will be resisted separately.</p>
<h4 id="gaining-paradox">Gaining Paradox</h4>
<p>When reality resists a feat, set your paradox complication equal to the size of effect dice you attempted. If the effect die is equal to or less than your current paradox, step up your paradox instead.</p>
<p>When you attempt vulgar magick in front of sleeper witnesses, your paradox is stepped up once regardless of whether your feat succeeds or fails.</p>
<p>Attempting vulgar magick without sleeper witnesses doesn’t automatically earn your paradox, but it is still dangerous.</p>
<h4 id="losing-paradox">Losing Paradox</h4>
<p>There are some ways to help deal with paradox. A familiar can share the burden with a mage, or a Prime effect can be used to trigger a paradox backlash in a controlled environment. But there are no known ways of removing or avoiding paradox.</p>
<p>Paradox will continue to build up until it all discharges in a single event known as a backlash.</p>
<h3 id="backlash">Backlash</h3>
<p>A backlash is a discharge that rends at the fabric of a mage’s being. When it occurs all of a mage’s accumulated paradox energy suddenly pours into their pattern in a cascade that either marks them with a weird or traps them in the dreaded quiet.</p>
<p>Reality can be strangely capricious about when exactly a backlash occurs. They can happen any time, but usually happen at the worst possible moments; such as when a mage’s working was resisted and they’ve suddenly accumulated a significant amount of paradox.</p>
<p>There are four possible effects of a backlash. When one happens you must choose two of the effects to inflict upon your mage. Many of them can be chosen twice with increasingly serious consequences.</p>
<h4 id="burn">Burn</h4>
<p>When the energies of a paradox course through your pattern and injure your flesh, it’s call burn.</p>
<p>Turn your paradox complication in a physical harm complication.</p>
<p>If you choose burn twice, instead take a permanent d6 physical complication, or step up an existing one. This physical complication is also a mystick trait. It represents a scar in your metaphysical being and cannot be healed. It will persist however else you might change your life pattern.</p>
<p>If a harm complication is larger then d12 you will face death.</p>
<h4 id="permanent-paradox">Permanent Paradox</h4>
<p>Sometimes paradox permanently invades your pattern and grows there like a cancer, twisting your being into a nightmarish offense to reality.</p>
<p>Take a d6 permanent paradox complication, or step up your existing one. This counts as two choices.</p>
<p>You now always have a paradox complication from which to begin accumulating more. When you experience backlash, it’s at your current level, but instead of removing all paradox, you return to the level of your permanent trait.</p>
<p>If your permanent paradox ever exceeds d12 your mage looses protagonist status and becomes an NPC.</p>
<h4 id="weirds">Weirds</h4>
<p>Often paradox will mark you in ways that make it difficult to pass for mortal like spoiling milk and wilting plants in your presence, or causing you to vomit snakes wherever you attempt to speak a lie. These strange effects are called weirds, and many of them have become a familiar part of magick even in the larger sleeper culture. All the better to make a mage as different and dangerous.</p>
<p>Turn your paradox complication into a weird complication that will last until you can activate enough opportunities to remove it.</p>
<p>If you choose this twice, instead take a permanent d6 weird, or step up an existing one.</p>
<p>Like the other forms of paradox backlash, a weird is a change to a mage’s pattern and cannot be healed or concealed.</p>
<p>The larger the weird complication the more serious, obvious, and limiting it is. Weirds larger then d12 can not simply be reduced by activating opportunities, the mage will require some kind of narrative justification to began the recovery process.</p>
<p>There is no limit to the size of a weird. It can exceed d12 without turning you into an NPC, but weirds that large are very limiting.</p>

<h4 id="quiet">Quiet</h4>
<p>Sometimes a paradox backlash attacks the mage with hallucinations, personality changes, madness, and vegetative states which serve to disconnect them from their community, their mind, and reality itself.</p>
<p>Quiet is much feared by mages because it pulls apart already tenuous groups and leaves individuals vulnerable and alone. Severe Quiets leave the mage in a total vegetative state, stripped of magickal power, and only able to interact with a strange nightmare world.</p>
<p>Turn your paradox complication into a Quiet complication that will last until you can activate enough opportunities to remove it.</p>
<p>If you choose this twice, instead take a permanent d6 quiet, or step up an existing one.</p>
<p>Deep Quiets, larger then d12, place the mage’s body in a vegetative state, and trap their mind in an endless hallucination unable to access their magickal ability. Escaping from deep quiet requires more then simply activating some opportunities. This could be a solo quest for the mage, similar to a Seeking for increased Arete. Or simply narrated as a montage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>some notes to make here. Need to clean up the correspondence and prime vs. just strait up duration traits. So that it’s clear how to make an effect.<br />
also, need to workout what happens when you target someone.<br />
I think this right now: if you target a sleeper, they can’t resist with magic. They can maybe resist with mundane traits, based on your effect, but that’s it. As a mage you have to beat both reality and their resistance? or maybe not. Maybe you can just blurg sleepers all you want?<br />
if you target someone with magick though, they can add their arete and avatar rating, which now becomes a trait, to reality’s dice pool. or maybe just avatar? eithe rway, they are harder to effect, and if they detect your working they can work their own countermagick which allows them to roll a full magickal counter?<br />
then what? the main issue here is do we add to reality’s dice pool, or do we all for a second resistance roll that you must also beat? Either one is possible, but which is easier?<br />
if its a second roll, like, someone could still roll to dodge the physical manifestation of your spell? I don’t like that. but if we just add to reality’s pool…the main thing to ask is how avatar and arete actually work. logically, not mechanically. the more you know about how magick works in the SETTING the easier these kinds of questions are to answer. Therefore, as a mage you can resist a working directed at you with your avatar. And various sanctums traits and such for your location. If you are aware of the working and resist it, you can add your arete. If you practice some countermagick based on your correct<br />
Counter-magick is page 546 in the m20 book<br />
from their perspective, if you successfully create a fireball you still have to hit someone with it.<br />
which I am dubious about.<br />
thats two rolls for the same thing. and, if your working includes, say, shoot for shooting, then there’s no need to make a second attack roll, but…and this is a but, it may be that they can dodge your physical attack if they can see it coming. Which does kinda mean that they get a chance to make a roll to beat your total. just like reality does. eh, there are worse things.<br />
be free with information to the players. There’s no need to hide things. With Cortex plus it will all even out.<br />
which says to me, that you can dodge physical effects maybe, you can also resist magic if you have an avatar and some arete.  Avatar is always added.<br />
I wonder if you could thus, mundanely resist mind control? that’s what willpower was suppose to be for.</p>

<h2 id="rituals">Rituals</h2>
<p>[draft] If two mages have compatible paradigms they can cooperate on a working with a greater chance of success.</p>
<p>For ritual workings, I think you can pool your sphere dice together. And perhaps Arete? Probably. You can pool your Raw magick dice and get greater chance of success, but of course, if there’s paradox involved, it will apply to every mage in the working.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Describe the narrative effect you want and decide the Effect dice, Duration, Range, and Scope, then roll your Magick dice pool.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Magick Dice Pool. Arete, the Spheres needed for the effect, and a Casting Time die for how long you take to work the effect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your two highest dice are you total. (Your Effect die comes from your initial choice, not from your dice pool)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunities you roll can be activated to add/step up your Paradox; or to trigger a backlash complication.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Then Reality rolls a reaction against your working using: your Effect dice the level of the Spheres required for the effect, and the Duration, Range and Scope you decided upon.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If there are Sleeper witnesses Reality can add a die from d6 to d12 depending on how many there are and how rigid their sense of reality is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your working is Vulgar Reality gets 3 dice for it’s total.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your working is Coincidental Reality only gets 2 for it’s total and Sleepers can be used as an Asset.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunities can be activated to trigger a Paradox backlash of your own choice.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If your total meets or beats reality’s your effect is successful and you can apply your Effect dice to your targets.</p>
<p>If you fail, your effect dice get added to your Paradox or trigger a backlash that may draw in more of your existing Paradox.</p>
