[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Nevenall/BookShelf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Nevenall/BookShelf)


BookShelf is a Material Design [progressive web app](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/) template for hosting and navigating static html fragments. 

BookShelf has only a small subset of the features other documentation and static site generators do. It's essentially a template intended to be forked and customized. 

Some reasons to check it out:

- Fast, light, and flexible
- Excellent mobile device support
- All the benefits of a Progressive Web App
  - Notably, the entire site can be read offline

## Running Instances (works in progress)

To see a live instance check out one of these:

- [Ghosting the Edge](https://ghosting.bookshelf.press)
- [Shift-X](https://shift-x.bookshelf.press)
- [Sufficient Reason](https://sufficientreason.bookshelf.press)

## Usage 

1. Just fork the repository and add your own html fragments to the `src/pages` directory
2. Delete or edit `firebase.json` and `.travis.yml` to fit your own CI/Hosting needs
3. Edit the pageOrder object in `book.js`  
4. Place your custom styles in `book.scss`
